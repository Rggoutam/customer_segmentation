# Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation using Python and PowerBI

## Dataset
Data has been obtained from real sales orders in 18 countries in a period of around 2 years. Some features (country names, customer id and revenue), have been altered in order to preserve privacy. Number of orders, units and dates have not been modified. 

## Background
Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. In particular, it evaluates customers’ recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).
This project focuses on doing RFM analysis on company sales and creating a data visualization dashboard showcasing customer segmentation that can be shared.

## Dashboard
We create a two page report in PowerBI, working with the CSV file generated by the Python code.
